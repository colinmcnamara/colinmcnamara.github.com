        	<h1>A little about me</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>My name is Colin McNamara, I am <a href="#"></a> an engineer who over the years has written scripts and code to automate  simple and sometimes complex tasks in managing systems and network elements. Over the years this has included automating the network deployments of some of the largest data centers on earth.<br />
        </p>
            <p>Sadly, many of the scripts I have written have disapeered into long lost home directories and backup volumes. Luckily with git and github I can still maintain my local copies and keep a copy of projects I am working on online.<br />

        <h1>My interests - OpenStack and DevOps</h1>
            <div class="contentText">
              <p>I have been using Linux since 1998, and over the years my interests have wandered around Open Source  projects releated to it. Currently my biggest interests are in Open Stack and DevOps tools like Puppet.  And very specifically automating deployment and testing of OpenStack development builds are a current project I am working on.<br />
